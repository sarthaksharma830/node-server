# Express Generator

Use the `express-generator` tool to quickly generate an application skeleton.

```bash
$ npm install -g express-generator
```

To create an application named ___myapp___, run the following commands

```bash
$ express myapp
$ cd myapp
$ npm install
```

It will create the application template and install the dependencies. To run the application,

```bash
$ npm start
```

The express server listens at port 3000 by default. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to view the application

## Other links to try

* http://localhost:3000/users/
* http://localhost:3000/say-hello/
* http://localhost:3000/heroes/json/

The last two routes have been added to this project manually, and are not included in the default application template generated by `express-generator`
